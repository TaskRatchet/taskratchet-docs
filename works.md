## How It Works

TaskRatchet is the only todo list that makes you do the tasks you add. 

### Add a Task

When adding a task, TaskRatchet asks you for three pieces of information:

- The definition of the task--what is it you need to do?
- A deadline, specified as a date and time.
- The amount of money you'll be charged if you don't complete it in time.

### Get Reminded

Currently, the only reminder that TaskRatchet has is a daily summary email which includes all your tasks you haven't yet
completed. This is almost certainly not the optimal solution. If you have opinions regarding how reminders should work,
please email me at nathan@taskratchet.com. The more feedback I can get on how people would like reminders to work, the
better!

### Complete the Task

If all goes well, you check off the task in your list before the deadline comes, and that's it! You won't be charged
for that task.

### Fail to Complete the Task

If you don't mark the task as complete on time, a series of events are triggered:

- Within 6 hours of the deadline TaskRatchet will email you telling you that you're about to be charged. At this point, 
  you can reply to the email saying the charge isn't legit, and the charge will be immediately stopped until I can work 
  out with you what should be done.
- Within 30 hours of the deadline TaskRatchet will initiate a charge which will show up in your bank, but won't have
  yet been finalized. At this point you can still ask me to cancel the charge, and I can cancel it without the money
  actually leaving your account.
- Within 54 hours of the deadline TaskRatchet will finalize the charge, removing the money from your account. If the 
  charge really wasn't legit and you're only getting around to telling me, don't worry! I can still refund you the
  charge.

### Calling a Charge Not Legit

Depending on the situation, you may feel that a particular charge isn't legit. Reasons could be:

- You completed the task on time but didn't manage to mark it as complete in the app on time.
- You included a condition for discarding the task in its description.
- You have some rules defined externally for when a charge should not be considered legitimate.

Even if your reason isn't listed above, you can go ahead and email me, including the reason you're calling not legit.

The preferred way to call not legit on a charge is to reply directly to the email telling you you're getting charged. By
doing this, the charge is automatically paused until I can respond to you. Once we've agreed that your charge should be
cancelled, I'll go ahead and cancel the charge, or, if it's already been finalized, I'll issue you a refund.
