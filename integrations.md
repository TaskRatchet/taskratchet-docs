## Integrations

### Beeminder

- Navigate to your account settings.
- Click "Enable Beeminder integration."
- You'll be redirected to Beeminder's website.
- Grant TaskRatchet access to your Beeminder account.
- You'll be redirected back to your account settings.
- Add the name of the Beeminder goal you'd like TaskRatchet to post your new tasks to.
- Click "Save."

Now, whenever you add a new task, a 1 will be posted to the goal you specified in your account settings.

In addition, you can add a `&goal-name` tag to a task's description to post to a goal on task create, and `*goal-name`
to post to the goal on task complete.
