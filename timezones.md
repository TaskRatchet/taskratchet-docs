## Timezones

### How Timezones Work

TaskRatchet uses the timezone you select to determine when your tasks are due. If you specify that a task is due at 6pm,
the task is due at 6pm in your specified timezone. If you change your timezone, your existing task will now be due at
6pm in your new timezone.

### How to Change Your Timezone

- [Open your account settings](https://app.taskratchet.com/account)
- Use the "Timezone" dropdown to change your timezone
- Click or tap the "Save" button directly below the "Timezone" dropdown

You should see a "Changes saved" message. Once you do, your timezone has been changed, and all due dates will now be
treated in reference to your new timezone.
