TaskRatchet isn't the only option around! If you find TaskRatchet interesting, we think you'll
like these tools, too:

### Commitment Contracts

- [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/home) - "Your goals can be anything quantifiable — weight, pushups, minutes 
spent on Facebook, points on Duolingo. Answer with your number when Beeminder asks — or connect a device/app below to 
auto-report — and we'll show your progress and a Yellow Brick Road to follow to stay on track. If you go off track, you 
pledge money to stay on the road the next time. If you go off track again, we charge you."
- [commits.to](http://commits.to/) - "Create a commitment by constructing a URL like "alice.commits.to/send_the_report" 
and just by clicking on such a URL, a commitment is logged here."
- [stickK](https://www.stickk.com/) - "By asking our users to sign Commitment Contracts, stickK helps users define their 
goal (whatever it may be), acknowledge what it’ll take to accomplish it, and leverage the power of putting money on the 
line to turn that goal into a reality."

### Task Management

- [Amazing Marvin](https://amazingmarvin.com/) - "Marvin incorporates principles from behavioral psychology to help you 
beat procrastination, feel in control and finish your to-do list."
- [Taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/) - "Taskwarrior is Free and Open Source Software that manages your TODO list 
from the command line. It is flexible, fast, and unobtrusive. It does its job then gets out of your way."
- [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) - "Regain clarity and calmness by getting all those tasks out of your head and onto 
your to-do list (no matter where you are or what device you use)."
