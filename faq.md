## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is TaskRatchet free?

Yes! TaskRatchet is free to use forever. You will only be charged if you don't complete a task you've added by the
deadline you chose.

### Why does TaskRatchet need my payment details?

TaskRatchet allows you to commit to completing tasks by a deadline. If you don't make your deadline, you get charged
the amount you pledged on the task. Without your payment details, TaskRatchet isn't effective at ensuring you meet
the deadlines you've set.

### When does TaskRatchet charge me?

Soon after you miss a deadline, TaskRatchet will send you an email letting you know you're about to be charged. You can
reply to this email to pause the charge and let me know that the charge isn't legit. If you don't reply to the email,
about 24 hours later a charge will be authorized for the amount of your pledge and show up in your bank account. 24 
hours after that, the charge will be captured. 

### Can I try TaskRatchet out without adding my payment details?

Currently you can, but this isn't by design. Since any charges for late tasks won't succeed without valid payment
details, TaskRatchet won't be able to enforce the commitments you've made. In the future, payment details will be
required to use TaskRatchet.

### How do I unsubscribe from daily emails?

I am currently working hard on adding email preferences and unsubscribe to TaskRatchet, but I haven't completed it yet.
Until then, email me at nathan@taskratchet.com and I can manually unsubscribe you from daily emails.

### How can I deactivate or delete my account?

Email me at nathan@taskratchet.com letting me know whether you'd like me to delete or just deactivate your account, and
I'll get it done as soon as I can.

### Why doesn't TaskRatchet have \[feature\]?

TaskRatchet is built and maintained by a single developer, so I may plan to have certain features that I just haven't
had the time to build yet. Or, maybe I haven't thought of the feature yet! Email me at nathan@taskratchet.com with any
ideas, suggestions, or feedback. I love hearing your ideas!
